# notebooks

Github API exploration and small amount of maths

## Install Ipython notebook

Run ```pip install "ipython[notebook]"```

and then, at the root of this project

```ipython notebook``` should open a browser page.

## Install dependencies

Each ```import ***``` needs to be preceded by a ```!pip install ***```.

Some tricky packages are not installed and imported with the same name.

```!pip install PyGithub``` but ```import github```

ps : you can run commands directly from a notebook cell using ```!```.
